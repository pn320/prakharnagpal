Pretty much what the title says. I have final exams coming up in about 10 days, and so I've decided to document my studying. Not a journal, think more a preparation log (combined with a conceptual review of some of the topics). Let's jump right in to holding myself accountable. Also if it wasn't clear from the title, I hate exams.

So this term I'm going to be writing the following exams,

- Software Performance Engineering
- Robotics
- Computer Vision
- Data Processing Systems (formerly, Advanced Databases)
