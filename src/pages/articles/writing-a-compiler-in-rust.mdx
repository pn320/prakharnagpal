This is something I've been wanting to do for a while, especially since <CommonLink href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</CommonLink> gained traction and I decided to learn it. So, in this blog post I'm going to go over how I
wrote the compiler for my own toy programming language _Monk_.

So, let's define the syntax of the language and quickly whip up a lexer. Then we can move on to the more interesting things in life.
I'd like for the language to be clean, statically typed and have a good amount of syntactic sugar to make life easier for myself, especially compared to writing Java or C++.

## Defining the language syntax

<CH.Scrollycoding>

**Basic types and printing**
`Monk` has several basic types, `u32, f32, String, Vec<type>, char` corresponding to a 32 bit unsigned integer, 32 bit floating point, strings (more on their internal representation later), vectors of various types, and characters (single bit stores). I've also borrowed Rust's style of `print` statements, although we might switch to Python style `f-strings` later.

<CH.Code lineNumbers={true}>
```text assignment.mnk
str: String = "hello, world!"
x: u32 = 63
y: f32 = 63.0
c: char = 'a'
num_vec: Vec<u32> = [1, 2, 3]
```
