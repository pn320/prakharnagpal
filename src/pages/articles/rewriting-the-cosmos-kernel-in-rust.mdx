When we released the first version of cosmOS last year, it was written in Go. Go is a wonderful programming language with a lot of benefits, but it’s been a while since I’ve seen an article on the front page of Hacker News about rewriting some important tool in Go and I see articles on there about rewriting things in Rust every single <CommonLink href="/">week</CommonLink>.

```rust
use ferris_says::say;
use std::io::{stdout, BufWriter};

fn main() {
    let stdout = stdout();
    let message = String::from("Hello fellow hackers");
    let width = message.chars().count();

    let mut writer = BufWriter::new(stdout.lock());
    say(message.as_bytes(), width, &mut writer).unwrap();
}
```

I derive a large amount of my self-worth from whether or not Hacker News is impressed with the work I'm doing, so when I realized this, I cancelled all of our existing projects and started migrating everything to Rust immediately.

```python
def evaluate() -> None:
    print("In the evaluation function")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    evaluate()
```
