    'I decided to document the thought process and progress that went into writing my thesis for the final year of my BEng degree at Imperial. This is a thesis exploring the possibility of generating timelines for events using some custom machine learning models and building a google-like search index but one that works for a smaller subset of pages.',

It is that time of my degree. I thought I'd make it more fun for myself by writing about the process of researching, coding up, and writing my undergraduate thesis.

## What I'm going to be doing

My thesis, _Automated Temporal Relation Extraction and Ordering_, aims to answer the question of whether we can use NLP to extract temporal relationships and order them (in order to completely automate the tedious process of generating timelines) from text.

### Background

```python
def main():
    ...
```
