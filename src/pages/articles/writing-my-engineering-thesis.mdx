It is that time of my degree. I thought I'd make it more fun for myself by writing about the process of researching, coding up, and writing my undergraduate thesis.

My thesis, _Automated Temporal Relation Extraction and Ordering_, aims to answer the question of whether we can use NLP to extract temporal relationships and order them
(in order to completely automate the tedious process of generating timelines) from text. The end goal is to essentially be able to read a block of text (a corpus) and automatically generate a timeline of
events for the agents in the text. As a final goal, we will be generating a timeline for <CommonLink href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings">The Lord of the Rings</CommonLink>.

## Background on Natural Language Processing

In this section we're going to go over (briefly!) the basic underpinnings of modern NLP, most of this is a summary of <CommonLink href="https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/ed3book_jan72023.pdf">James H. Martin's Speech and Language Processing</CommonLink>
as well as some portions of <CommonLink href="https://github.com/jacobeisenstein/gt-nlp-class/blob/master/notes/eisenstein-nlp-notes.pdf">Georgia Tech's intro to NLP notes</CommonLink>.

The first thing we have to cover is the data statement of a corpus. The datasheet/data statement (can be used inter-changeably) specifies several properties of the dataset.

1. **Motivation:** Why was the corpus (text) collected, and by whom?
2. **Situation:** In what situation was the text written, spoken? Was there a specific task or report of something? Was it a monologue, did it contain several agents, etc. This is the one we will especially focus on since for the purpose of the project we will be focusing on corpora (multiple) that have several agents, and have a temporal element.

There are of course others, but for our purposes we will only look at these two questions when considering a corpus. Once these two questions have been answered we must then generate
