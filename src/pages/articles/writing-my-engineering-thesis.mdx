    'I decided to document the thought process and progress that went into writing my thesis for the final year of my BEng degree at Imperial. This is a thesis exploring the possibility of generating timelines for events using some custom machine learning models and building a google-like search index but one that works for a smaller subset of pages.',

It is that time of my degree. I thought I'd make it more fun for myself by writing about the process of researching, coding up, and writing my undergraduate thesis.

My thesis, _Automated Temporal Relation Extraction and Ordering_, aims to answer the question of whether we can use NLP to extract temporal relationships and order them (in order to completely automate the tedious process of generating timelines) from text.

## Background on Natural Language Processing

In this section we're going to go over (briefly!) the basic underpinnings of modern NLP, most of this is a summary of <CommonLink href="https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/ed3book_jan72023.pdf">James H. Martin's Speech and Language Processing</CommonLink> as well as some portions of <CommonLink href="https://github.com/jacobeisenstein/gt-nlp-class/blob/master/notes/eisenstein-nlp-notes.pdf">Georgia Tech's intro to NLP notes</CommonLink>.
