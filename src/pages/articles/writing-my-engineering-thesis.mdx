    'I decided to document the thought process and progress that went into writing my thesis for the final year of my BEng degree at Imperial. This is a thesis exploring the possibility of generating timelines for events using some custom machine learning models and building a google-like search index but one that works for a smaller subset of pages.',

It is that time of my degree. I thought I'd make it more fun for myself by writing about the process of researching, coding up, and writing my undergraduate thesis.

## What I'm going to be doing

I'm going to be writing an application that, given an event (for example the "Financial Crisis of 2008"), will automatically generate a timeline of events for the supplied event using machine learning and building an index of context relevant articles for events. Sort of like google, except on a much smaller scale and with some interesting machine learning!

```python
def main() -> None:
    print("this is the main function!")
```
