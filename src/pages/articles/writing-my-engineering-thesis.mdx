    'I decided to document the thought process and progress that went into writing my thesis for the final year of my BEng degree at Imperial. This is a thesis exploring the possibility of generating timelines for events using some custom machine learning models and building a google-like search index but one that works for a smaller subset of pages.',

```python hello.py
print("Rendered with Code Hike")
```
