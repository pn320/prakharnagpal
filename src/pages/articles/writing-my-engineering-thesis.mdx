    'I decided to document the thought process and progress that went into writing my thesis for the final year of my BEng degree at Imperial. This is a thesis exploring the possibility of generating timelines for events using some custom machine learning models and building a google-like search index but one that works for a smaller subset of pages.',

It is that time of my degree. I thought I'd make it more fun for myself by writing about the process of researching, coding up, and writing my undergraduate thesis.

## What I'm going to be doing

I'm going to be writing an application that, given an event (for example the "Financial Crisis of 2008"), will automatically generate a timeline of events for the supplied event using machine learning and building an index of context relevant articles for events. Sort of like google, except on a much smaller scale. So basically, I'm taking what Sergey Brin and Larry Page did in 2002 and doing it again!

## Setting up our project

Let's set up this project first. We need a python file, and an entry point to the script. Here we have the entry point (that requires an argument, hence the check for `len(args)` list) and some utillity functions defined in another file. For the time being they're just stub functions, we'll fill them in later.
The graph type is simply an adjacency list representation for the time being. Now let's see how we're going to make our life super easy while running this repeatedly.

<CH.Code>

```python main.py focus=5 rows={1}
#!/usr/bin/env python3

from timeline import scan_index, generate_timeline

if __name__ == "__main__":
	if not len(args) == 2:
		return
	event = args[1]
	event_graph = scan_index(event)
    generate_timeline()
```

```python timeline.py
Graph = dict[str, list[str]]
def scan_index(event: str) -> Graph:
	return {}

def generate_timeline() -> None:
	...
```

</CH.Code>

## Running the file with the entry point in vim!
Here we're going to set a keymap since I don't like typing `python3 _filename` everytime I want to run a file in vim. So, we're going to make this file executable first, by running `:!chmod +x %`

<CH.Code>
```python main.py focus=1
#!/usr/bin/env python3

from timeline import scan_index, generate_timeline

if __name__ == "__main__":
	if not len(args) == 2:
		return
	event = args[1]
	event_graph = scan_index(event)
    generate_timeline()
```

```python timeline.py
Graph = dict[str, list[str]]
def scan_index(event: str) -> Graph:
	return {}

def generate_timeline() -> None:
	...
```
</CH.Code>
