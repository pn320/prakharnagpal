Notes for COMP60009 - Distributed Algorithms.

## #1. What constitutes a distributed system and algorithms

Essentially, when we think of a distributed system we have to think of it as a system made up of 2 main parts.

- The first is the components (_processes_) that make up the system and perform the computation or handle requests. This could be anything from an entire computer, a processor on a computer, or even a thread running on a processor on a computer. It could

## #2. Elixir Basics (mostly the stuff I'm trying to understand)

- _Data types_: There's some basic data types like `int, float, bool, list, tuple`
- _Atoms_: This is one of the constructs that I think will seem more useful as time goes

## #3. Processes and message passing

A simple example of a server and client communicating in Elixir,

## #3.1. System setup and overview

Here we want to create a simple system with one server and client communicating and this is how we're going to do it in Elixir.

<CH.Code>

```elixir cluster.exs
defmodule System do

def start do
    # spawning a node at the address specified
    server = Node.spawn(:'server_node@172.19.1.21', Server, :start, [])
    client = Node.spawn(:'server_node@172.19.1.20', Client, :start, [])


end
```

</CH.Code>

## #3.2 Server setup

Here we're going to describe how the server should respond to messages it recieves from _for the time being_ a single client (we will expand this to handle multiple clients). We set it up to catch any messages in a variable

<CH.Code>

```elixir server.exs
defmodule Server do

def start do
end
```

</CH.Code>

---

## #3.3 Client communication

Here we're going to set up the client module to send messages to the server of the type `circle` or `square` and recieve the responses.

<CH.Code>

```elixir client.exs
defmodule Client do

def start do
end
```

</CH.Code>
