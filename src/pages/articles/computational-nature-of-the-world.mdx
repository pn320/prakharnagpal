There is a popular paradox posed by Zeno(?) (I'm not a historian, just a geek who loves puzzles) that goes like this. Suppose there is a tortoise and hare such that the hare can run <b>twice as fast</b> as the tortoise, and the tortoise is given a <b>1000 meter headstart</b>. If the two keep on running, <b>will the hare eventually catch up with the tortoise?</b>

Before we write any equations or formal proofs, let's just write out some steps. Suppose the hare covers 1000 meters, the tortoise will still have
