This is something I've been wanting to do for a while, especially since <CommonLink href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</CommonLink> gained traction and I decided to learn it. So, in this blog post I'm going to go over how I 
wrote the compiler for my own toy programming language _Monk_.

So, let's define the syntax of the language and quickly whip up a lexer. Then we can move on to the more interesting things in life.
I'd like for the language to be clean, statically typed and have a good amount of syntactic sugar to make life easier for myself, especially compared to writing Java or C++.
These are some of the basic features I've implemented so far.

<CH.Scrollycoding>
**Simple assignment statements with types**
The language uses a simple, clean assignment statement. Put the value inside the `{}` braces and prefix it with a `=`.
So, we have `<type> terribly_named_variable ={<expr>}`
<CH.Code lineNumbers={true}>

```monk sample.mnk 
int x ={15}
int y ={20}
string s ={"hello, world!"}
float d ={20.0}
```

</CH.Code>

---
**Simple arithmetic operations**
Pretty self explanatory, basic support for arithmetic operations. At the moment, only the `int` and `float` types are supported for numerics, althought I might add some more in the future

<CH.Code lineNumbers={true}>

```monk sample.mnk focus=3,5
int x ={15}
int y ={20}
int z ={x+y}
// `int` is a subtype of `double`
double d ={x + y} 
```

</CH.Code>
---
**Printing values**
Any simple values go simply in the function call. Yes, `print` is a function call. I would love to have it be like 
<CommonLink href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-02-hello-world.html#anatomy-of-a-rust-program">Rust's print macro</CommonLink>
but I prefer to be sane for atleast another couple of years. If you want to print an inline expression just add the `={<expr>}` in the print call. At some point I might add support for `f-strings` like 
<CommonLink href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#tut-f-strings">python</CommonLink> does, but for the moment we're sticking with this.
<CH.Code lineNumbers={true}>

```monk sample.mnk focus=4,5,6
int x ={15}
int y ={20}
string s ={"hello, world!"}
println!("the value of x is ", x)
println!(={x+y})
println!(s, " world!")
```

</CH.Code>
</CH.Scrollycoding>

Right. We now have a baseline for the syntax and how we express basic functionality. We can hammer out the rest later as we
go along.

## Writing the lexer

The lexer is pretty simple.
I&apos;ve chosen to use a character by character scan and peek mechanism to write the lexer by hand.
I&apos;ll be going over the components briefly, especially basic syntax error handling (unterminated strings, etc.)
