This is something I've been wanting to do for a while, especially since <CommonLink href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</CommonLink> gained traction and I decided to learn it. So, in this blog post I'm going to go over how I
wrote the compiler for my own toy programming language _Monk_.

So, let's define the syntax of the language and quickly whip up a lexer. Then we can move on to the more interesting things in life.
I'd like for the language to be clean, statically typed and have a good amount of syntactic sugar to make life easier for myself, especially compared to writing Java or C++.
I'm going to go over some example programs in the languages so you get an idea of the syntax and features expected from any language.
