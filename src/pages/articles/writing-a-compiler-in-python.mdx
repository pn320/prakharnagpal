This is something I've been wanting to do for a while, especially since <CommonLink href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</CommonLink> gained traction and I decided to learn it. So, in this blog post I'm going to go over how I 
wrote the compiler for my own toy programming language _Monk_.

So, let's define the syntax of the language and quickly whip up a lexer. Then we can move on to the more interesting things in life.
I'd like for the language to be clean, statically typed and have a good amount of syntactic sugar to make life easier for myself, especially compared to writing Java or C++.
This is a bunch of simple programs in the language,

<CH.Scrollycoding>
**Simple assignment statements with types**
The language uses a simple, clean assignment statement. Put the value inside the `{}` braces and prefix it with a `=`.
<CH.Code lineNumbers={true}>

```monk sample.mnk 
int x ={15}
int y ={20}
string s ={"hello, world!"}
float d ={20.0}
```

</CH.Code>

---
**Simple arithmetic operations**
Pretty self explanatory, basic support for arithmetic operations. At the moment, only the `int` and `float` types are supported for numerics, althought I might add some more in the future

<CH.Code lineNumbers={true}>

```monk sample.mnk 
int x ={15}
int y ={20}
int z ={x+y}
// `int` is a subtype of `double`
double d ={x + y} 
```

</CH.Code>
---
**Printing values**
Any simple values go simply in the function call. Yes, `print` is a function call. I would love to have it be like 
<CommonLink href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-02-hello-world.html#anatomy-of-a-rust-program">Rust's print macro</CommonLink>
but I prefer to be sane for atleast another couple of years. If you want to print an inline expression just add the `={<expr>}` in the print call. At some point I might add support for `f-strings` like python does,
but for the moment we're sticking with this.
<CH.Code lineNumbers={true}>

```shellscript pn320@localhost
$ imnk
Welcome to Monk(s) interpreter. A simple programming language
|>> int x ={15}
|>> int y ={5}
|>> println!(={x+y})
15
|>> string s ={"hello, world!"}
|>> println!(s)

```

</CH.Code>

## Writing the lexer

The lexer is pretty simple. I've chosen to use a character by character scan and peek mechanism to write the lexer by hand. I'll be going over the components briefly, especially basic syntax error handling
